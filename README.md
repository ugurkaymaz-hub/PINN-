# Physics-Informed Neural Networks for the Kuramotoâ€“Sivashinsky Equation

This repository contains the implementation of a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) to solve the Kuramotoâ€“Sivashinsky (KS) equation. The code is written in Python and can be executed in **Google Colab**, **Jupyter Notebook**, or **VSCode**.

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

This project is part of a master's thesis that aims to solve the Kuramotoâ€“Sivashinsky equation using a data-driven method based on PINNs. Instead of relying solely on labeled data, the model leverages physical laws directly embedded into the loss function, including the PDE residual, initial condition, and boundary condition errors.

## ðŸš€ How to Run

1. Clone or download this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ks-pinn.git
   cd ks-pinn
